![Illustration of a vintage computer with a keyboard and a CRT monitor displaying JavaScript and TypeScript code. The code on the screen references the Moment.js library for date and time manipulation. Next to the computer, there is a pixelated logo, possibly representing TypeScript, with a background featuring curved lines on a black canvas. The image blends a retro technology aesthetic with modern programming concepts.](./.github/assets/js-ts.jpeg)
